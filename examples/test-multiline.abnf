; Test file with multi-line ABNF rules
; This tests the parser's ability to distinguish between rule boundaries and continuation lines

; Simple single-line rule
simple-rule = "hello" CRLF

; Multi-line rule with alternation spanning lines
multi-line-alt = "option1" /
                 "option2" /
                 "option3"

; Multi-line rule with concatenation
multi-line-concat = "start" 
                   "middle"
                   "end"

; Multi-line rule with complex structure
complex-rule = ( "group1" /
                 "group2" ) 
               [ "optional" 
                 "part" ]
               1*DIGIT

; Rule with comments on continuation lines
rule-with-comments = "begin"  ; start here
                     "continue"  ; keep going
                     "finish"    ; end here

; Another simple rule to test boundary detection
final-rule = "done"
